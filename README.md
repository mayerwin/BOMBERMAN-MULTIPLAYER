## ðŸŽ® Each Time You Want to Play on LAN
An IPX server (like IPXBox) is not strictly necessary, as IPXWrapper makes it possible for computers to communicate to each other directly without a central server, but without one the game unfortunately [lags](https://github.com/solemnwarning/ipxwrapper/issues/14).

1. **Start the IPX server (host computer only)**  
   - Run `start-ipxbox-server.bat`.  
   - A pop-up will display the **IP address of the server**.  
   - Share this address with other players.

2. **Set the server address (on each client computer)**  
   - Open `ipxwrapper.ini`.  
   - Find the line:  
     ```
     dosbox server address = 127.0.0.1
     ```  
   - Replace `127.0.0.1` with the **IP address from the host**.

3. **Start the game**  
   - Run `start-bomberman.bat`.

4. **Choose the network option**  
   - In the game, select **IPX** as the network mode to play multiplayer.
